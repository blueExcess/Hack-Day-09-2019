# Hack-Day-09-2019
What I created for Holberton Hack Day 1, Sep 20th, 2019.

## Requirements
We were required to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game from scratch in a programming language we had never seen before. I ended up going with Perl because I liked how the name sounded and I figured it would be more useful to learn Perl than it would to learn Basic or some other language like that. 

Here is a link to the finished website for our cohort - two other projects in two other languages. I think it looks quite nice. [Hackday](http://nhv-hack.holberton.us)
